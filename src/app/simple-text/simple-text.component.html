  Poop on couch i like fish or pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!. Pretend you want to go out but then don't ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway yet curl into a furry donut. Pretend not to be evil. Cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything. Lick butt and make a weird face mice mouse so check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. Scratch meoooow so eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap unwrap toilet paper yet hide head under blanket so no one can see and gnaw the corn cob. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter lick butt and make a weird face yet lick yarn hanging out of own butt and really likes hummus. Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me, steal the warm chair right after you get up. Purr when being pet push your water glass on the floor, yet steal the warm chair right after you get up. Sit and stare i shredded your linens for you so soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr. All of a sudden cat goes crazy sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away. Curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Who's the baby get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper, eat owner's food or cry louder at reflection but play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard and at four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in. Intently stare at the same spot stare out cat door then go back inside, hack up furballs yet scoot butt on the rug yet allways wanting food destroy couch as revenge. Eat fish on floor put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed sit on human they not getting up ever.
